Enqueue means add an element at the end of queue ( offer )
Dequeue means remove the element from top of queue ( poll )

QUEUES

Queues are interface in java so it cannot be instantiated directly

1) Declaring a Queue

Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

                 or

Queue<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();

summary of queue methods
---------------------------

Throws Exception                   Returns special value

add(e)                                  offer(e)
remove()                                poll()
element()                               peek()

Here we can use both the methods, but for example when is empty and you try to use remove(),
 it throws exception but poll() doesn't throw exception, instead it returns something like this [].

 So it is better to use offer(), poll(), peek().

 2) To add elements to the queue

 queue.offer(10);

 3) to remove from the queue

 queue.poll(10);

 4) to see the first item in the queue

 queue.peek();


Queue interface extends Collection interface, so we have some useful methods here as follows

5) to check if the queue is empty

queue.isEmpty();

6) to check if queue contains a specific element

queue.contains(10);

7) to get the size

queue.size();
